#
# The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which
# the corresponding bits are different.
# 
# Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.
# 
# Note:
# 0 ≤ x, y < 231.
# 
# 
# Example:
# 
# Input: x = 1, y = 4
# 
# Output: 2
# 
# Explanation:
# 1   (0 0 0 1)
# 4   (0 1 0 0)
# ⁠      ↑   ↑
# 
# The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are
# different.
