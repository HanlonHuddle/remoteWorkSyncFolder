# 
# Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the
# tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between
# any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
# 
# 
# 
# Example:
# Given a binary tree 
# 
# ⁠         1
# ⁠        / \
# ⁠       2   3
# ⁠      / \     
# ⁠     4   5    
# 
# 
# 
# Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
# 
# 
# Note:
# The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges
# between them.
# 
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root):

            if rt == None:
                return 0
            l, r = depth(rt.left), depth(rt.right)
            ans = max(ans, l+r)
            return max(l, r) + 1
