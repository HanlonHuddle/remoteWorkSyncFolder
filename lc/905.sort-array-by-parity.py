# Testcase Example:  '[3,1,2,4]'
#
# Given an array A of non-negative integers, return an array consisting of all
# the even elements of A, followed by all the odd elements of A.
# 
# You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [3,1,2,4]
# Output: [2,4,3,1]
# The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= A.length <= 5000
# 0 <= A[i] <= 5000
